      <h2>For You 💚</h2>
      <p>Happy Birthday, my love.</p>

    <p>
    I don’t even know where to start, because seven months ago I never imagined I’d be building a whole little world just to say how much someone means to me. But here we are. And honestly, it feels right, because loving you feels right.
    </p>

    <p>
    I wanted to give you something even thoug it may not be much, I wanted to give you a place where you could slow down for a moment and feel what I feel every time I think about you. Every block, every click, every detail here was made with you in mind, because you’ve become such an important part of my life in such a short amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Seven months isn’t long by the calendar, but it’s been long enough for you to become my favorite person to talk to, my comfort on hard days and my happiness on the good ones. You’ve brought a kind of peace into my life that I didn’t even realize I was missing. Being with you feels easy, natural and safe....like I can just be myself without fear.
    </p>

    <p>
    I love the way you make me laugh, the way you think, the way you care, even when you don’t notice that you’re doing it. I love the little moments we share.... the conversations, the jokes, the quiet times, the memories we’re still creating. Those are the moments that stay with me the most.
    </p>

    <p>
    This world you’re exploring is really just a reflection of how I see us. Still building. Still learning. Still discovering new things. And I love that. I love that we’re growing together, one moment at a time, without rushing, just choosing each other every day.
    </p>

    <p>
    I’m so proud of you, not just today, but always. Of who you are, of how far you’ve come and of the person you’re becoming. You inspire me more than you know and I feel lucky to be by your side, even this early on in our story.
    </p>

    <p>
    So on your birthday, I just want you to remember this: you are loved deeply, genuinely and intentionally. And no matter where life takes us or how difficult the level gets, I’m grateful that I get to be on this journey with you.
    </p>

    <p>
    Happy Birthday, my favorite player, my safe place, my person.
    </p>

    <p>
    I love you..... more than I can put into words, but I hope this world helps you feel it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Always yours,<br>
    <strong>Your babyyyyyy</strong> 💚🎮
